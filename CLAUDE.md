# CLAUDE.md — OTVP Dashboard (Legacy)

## Status: Deprecated — Use otvp-app Instead

This was the original static page deployed to Vercel to display envelope status for the 11 OTVP security controls. It has been superseded by **otvp-app**, which adds authentication, agent triggering, and dynamic rendering.

## Keep For

- Reference implementation for envelope display logic
- Quick testing of static layouts
- Fallback if otvp-app has issues

## Do Not

- Add new features here — they go in otvp-app
- Deploy to production — otvp-app is the production interface
- Invest significant development time here

## Context

See `~/otvp-projects/CLAUDE.md` for the full OTVP system overview and how the repos relate.
